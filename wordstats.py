Play a tic-tac-toe game against the computer.

The user always starts playing first.  The user marks a space on the grid by
clicking on that space.  That space is then colored with the userâ€™s assigned
color. The computer immediately plays its move by coloring an available space
with the other color. The game goes on until one player
(the user or the computer) has 3 colored spaces in a line.
